## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure your code follows the existing style.
4. Update the documentation if needed.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD-3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD-3 License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker]
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Keep JSON formatting consistent with the existing structure
* Comment your KQL queries for clarity
* Use meaningful names for variables and parameters
